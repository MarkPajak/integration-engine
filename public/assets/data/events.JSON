The large 'eye-spots' on the wing are thought to divert attacks by birds from the vulnerable body of the butterfly to the wings, which can survive being torn by a bird's beak.  \n\nGardens and parks play a very important role in providing paces for this beautiful insect to find food both as an adult looking for nectar and as a caterpillar eating nettle plants.  Although still relatively common, numbers can decline rapidly if their habitat is lost.","title":"Biology , Ai1168","width":"2569","height":"1712","name":"Natural History drawing day: Butterflies and beetles","orientation":"landscape"}]},{"type":"Historical Walk","strapline":"Explore the sites and learn about the causes and consequences of the bloody and brutal riots of 1831.","timings":"","priceDetails":"Limited spaces available.
