The umbrella title for this series is Modern Art in Britain.\n\nModern Art in Britain \n5 exhibitions and displays across 5 collections featuring over 50 artists\nThis series of exhibitions in Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham and Swindon looks at British approaches to Modernism through themes of reality and fantasy, domesticity and foreign lands, space and time, bodies and stories. All include loans from the Swindon Collection and between them span 100 years of British painting and works on paper. \n\nReality Questioned: Form David Bomberg to Tala Madani\nReality Questioned will bring together paintings from Bristol?s own 20th century British collection with key works from Swindon Museum and Art Gallery, as well as a recent acquisition by contemporary artist Tala Madani. Presenting works by artists such as Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, David Bomberg and Eric Ravilious, this exhibition charts artists? engagement with reality and what it means.\n\nIn their quest to forge a new style for a new age the artists featured in Reality Questioned experimented with primitivism, illusion, visual puns and abstractions. No longer content with reflecting external reality, these artists did not seek to imitate form but to create it. The works have a pictorial reality of their own.","images":[{"irn":163912,"type":"image","filename":"163912.jpg","rights":"\u00a9 Bristol Culture","caption":"Digital screen sign for Reality Questioned

Little is known of Pocock's experience of the slave trade, but as a traveller in the West Indies he would certainly have been aware of it. In the drawings he shows two distinct groups of African figures, the enslaved and manacled men, but also those trading goods, including guns, in exchange for their fellow Africans. The activity is drawn without emotion or censure, the trading of people treated very much as a matter of fact. The depiction of Africans in positions of power, colluding in the trade, offers a complex perspective on the actualities of the transatlantic slave trade.
